    <h1>Giuliana Ceschini's MEDPL150 Porfolio</h1>

    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>

    <p>A lot of my work is born during moments of introspection. As a result, my fiction films, often explore the relationship to oneself through supernatural elements and visions of the afterlife. As an agnostic, I have always been fascinated with the concepts of destiny and the afterlife and like to imagine my own versions of them. I also find human psychology to be an interesting subject, and I like exploring why people are the way they are, and why they make the decisions they make, so my films often feature supernatural companions that bring the character’s psyche to life to help explore and illustrate the character’s repressed thoughts.  In my non-fiction work, I like to analyze social structures and interactions to reveal how culture changes through time, and study how societal rules are expressed in film.

Although I make and love experimental art, and often use non-linear structures, and rhythmic editing, I am very nostalgic for the simpler times in filmmaking, so I like to use practical effects, and handmade costumes and props. These are not only stylistic choices, but a mean for me to leave a little piece of myself in every project.

Altogether, my work is searching for ways to make the invisible visible whether that means bringing a character’s inner world to life through a supernatural presence, or uncovering the hidden rules that shape our culture. My editing style, and art direction are what ties this body of work together, and it is through these choices that I continue to explore the fascinating topics of humanity and society.
